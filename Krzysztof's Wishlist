[x] script to extract query table or peptide table from mascot file
[] calculate mascot delta score and normalized mascot delta score
[x] 99 report quality script -> add functions to report quality metrics and plot histograms from tidy_df's
[x] distribution (frequency, not density) of single, double, triple and quadruple phosphorylated peptides (taken from df)
[] plots: clustering of dynamic phosphorylation profiles, Functional Categories of Regulated Phosphoproteins
  (please check F1000 :Fig3 and Fig4, Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks.)
[x] histograms -> rewrite from counts to density





[] for future: import profile for MaxQuant output to PDA workflow


FIX:
[] sitesMerge - different number of ann_IDs in peakData and annIntData
