  (please check F1000 :Fig3 and Fig4, Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks.)
[x] histograms -> rewrite from counts to density





[] for future: import profile for MaxQuant output to PDA workflow


FIX:
[] sitesMerge - different number of ann_IDs in peakData and annIntData
